            <h1>What is it?</h1>
            <p>KunLauncher was created to be an easy way to share applications in development with testers. Instead of zipping files and sending them over Google Drive, Discord, or MediaFire, instead they could just be downloaded from the Kun Launcher with a single click. KunLauncher has the ability to automatically update both itself and the applications it hosts, giving it the ability to carry out its purpose with ease.</p>

            <h1>Why is the download process retarded?</h1>
            <p>You might have noticed that this website is hosted with <a href="https://000webhost.com">000webhost</a>. 000webhost is a great hosting service for people who are learning or can't afford web hosting, both categories we fall into. Technically, there is no "release" file of the KunLauncher provided. Instead, the download page simply supplies a link to the file the Launcher itself downloads in order to perform updates. This file is named `latest.noexe` because 000webhost does not allow executable files to be hosted on their platform. This is likely to keep security tight, and we understand the reasoning. So we rename the file to latest.noexe and then just rename it when updating. Unfortunately, if you have to do this process yourself to download the launcher for the first time, it looks quite shady. Compare that with the fact that the executable is not signed (and Windows likes to complain about this), as well as a closed source, and the whole program looks quite shady. This is a necessary compromise, unfortunately, and right now there's nothing we can really do about it.</p>
